# AI_Tools_Projects

This repository contains various AI-related tools and projects implemented in Java and Python. These projects showcase different techniques and algorithms used in Artificial Intelligence.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

- **AiToolsJava**: Java-based AI tools and projects.
- **AiToolsPython**: Python-based AI tools and projects.

## Java Projects

### Knapsack Algorithm
A solution to the classical Knapsack problem using dynamic programming to maximize the total value of items that can be carried, given a weight constraint.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm
An implementation of the KNN algorithm for classification tasks, where the model predicts the class of a data point based on its nearest neighbors.

## Python Projects

### Huffman Tree
A Python implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm for data compression. It generates an optimal prefix code to minimize the average code length based on the frequency of characters in the input data.

### Local Search
A Python-based implementation of local search algorithms, which can be used to find approximate solutions to optimization problems like traveling salesman or n-queens.

### Perceptron
A simple implementation of the Perceptron learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. It demonstrates the foundational concepts of neural networks.
